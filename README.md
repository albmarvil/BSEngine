# Neon
Neon it's an arcade video game made in Unity 5

It also includes the primary version of the BSEngine. A set of tools and code useful for pre-production envrioment set-up.

The project is in early development so this readme will remain useless for the moment. A basic explanation of the engine structure will be included shortly :p
